# GameForWS
That'll be the full game for WS olympiad, that i took part at. Using only JS (with ES6 syntax) with no frameworks. Version (0.5)

This all started just as a test for some functions I wanted to try, but I decided to get this thing done

TODO:
1. Create scrolling of the screen
2. Basic UI (Menu, pause, stats, etc)
3. Textures
4. Animation
5. Add music
6. Character selection
7. Statistic saving and storing it on the DB
8. A lot of bug fix

OPTIONAL:
1. JSON Map creation
2. Few or so levels
3. Put on hosting
4. Move that entire project to Unity
5. Rebuild physics and control system
